About the book:
Struggling Columbia PhD computer science student William Arthur Lewis is close to making a world changing breakthrough. From Turing to Babbage, the dream of a truly sentient program has only been the stuff of science fiction. But, as part of an Army project to simulate human intelligence, he makes a discovery that may change the course of history. 
But not everyone is keen on him succeeding. The Compiling of Ada Love is an intelligent techno-thriller set in New York City. It will make you wonder if artificial intelligence could quickly evolve beyond what was intended.
